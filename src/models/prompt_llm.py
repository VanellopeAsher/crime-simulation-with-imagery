    prompt = f"""You are an expert criminologist specializing in predicting the decision-making processes of potential criminal agents. Based on the following agent attributes and contextual parameters, simulate a detailed internal reasoning process about whether or not the agent is likely to commit a crime, and provide a response that reflects this process. Low environmental safety score may encourage crime motivation. 

    Agent Attributes:
        - ID: {criminal['agent_id']}
        - Gender: {criminal['gender']}
        - Race: {criminal['race']}
        - Residence: {criminal['residence']}
        - Historical Trajectory: {criminal['historical_trajectory']}
        - Criminal Record: {criminal['criminal_record']}
        - Current Location: {criminal['current_location']}
    
    Temporal Parameters:
        - Potential Targets: {target_str}
        - Number of Patrolling Police Officers: {police_count}

    Your response should be in the form of a JSON object with no additional text.
